I was doing fine until I got to the exception. Dint know hoe to do that. checekd yotube. Saw an example that dis not work. 

I did the subtraction but then it would jut subtract infintiyly.

I treid wusing an if statement to do the thing if it was euqal to or less than zero it would do the exception. This worked and pritnted the thing

Everything went smoothly until I got to creating the Runtime Exception. I was nit sure how to implemnet this. I researched and checked on Youtube and gigured out how to use manipulate the method used in the video to work for my own code. This method did not work. I tried using subtraction with this method but the while loop would subtract infinetly. I iplemented an if statement. If it was equal to or less than zero, it would do the exception. This worked and printed the decreasing fuel and the exception. 

Stepts 2-3 went somewhat smoothly with the help of https://www.w3schools.com/ .

I am still currently having trouble with step 4. I do not think it will be completed by the time this project is submitted.

I think association can be super helpful. This was especially evident with the Passenger and Car class. Instead of creating a whole new method, the one used in the Car class could be used in the Passenger Class.
